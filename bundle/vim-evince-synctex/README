This script integrates synctex with Evince and GVIM.

It is a meshup between
 * tex_pdf.vim by Jeet Sukumaran
 * jlebl's version of evince_vim_dbus.py
with some minor additions by myself.

Howto:
 Copy this into your ~/.vim directory, or a subdirectory of bundle/ if you use
 pathogen. You'll have to add
  \synctex=1
 to your TeX-files or use the appropriate parameter for your TeX-Compiler.

 Afterwards, use <F9> to compile your TeX-files directly from vim and <S-F9> to
 additionaly open Evince automatically. If you type ls in normal mode, Evince will jump
 to that line.

 No improvements so far, that's the functionality offered by both scripts. My changes are:

  * If you compile using <S-F9> the helper script gets started automatically, so if you
    Control-Click onto a point in evince the cursor will jump to that line in VIM.
  * I changed the helper script such that it will end automatically when you close Evince
